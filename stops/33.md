History taught us that many had paid a great price to bring us the gospel, truth, life and the church. May we deeply treasure the all-inclusive Christ revealed to us and faithfully live the practical church life on the ground of oneness. Until we all arrive at the New Jerusalem, let us steadfastly journey on, continuing to write the divine story in our human history!

title: 里程碑

歷史教導我們歷世歷代許多愛基督的人付出極大的代價把福音、真理、生命和召會帶給我們。今天，願我們深深寶貴向我們所啟示的這位包羅萬有的基督，且在合一的立場上忠信活出實際的召會生活，直到我們都達到新耶路撒冷。願我們堅定持續往前，繼續在我們人類的歷史中寫下神聖的故事！

<!--- TRANSCRIPT
Dear brothers and sisters, history taught us that many lovers of Christ throughout the centuries had paid a great price to bring us the gospel, truth, life and the church. Today, may we deeply treasure the all-inclusive Christ revealed to us and faithfully live the practical church life on the ground of oneness. Until we all arrive at the New Jerusalem, let us steadfastly journey on, continuing to write the divine story in our human history!

Please enjoy the rest of the History Center by looking at the various photos on the walls and the collection of memorabilia on the shelves. Each item and picture holds a piece of the rich history and legacy of the Church in Manila. 

Thank you for joining us in this journey.

親愛的弟兄姊妹，歷史教導我們歷世歷代許多愛基督的人付出極大的代價把福音、真理、生命和召會帶給我們。今天，願我們深深珍惜向我們所啟示的這位包羅萬有的基督，且在合一的立場上忠信活出實際的召會生活。願我們堅定持續往前，繼續在我們人類的歷史中寫下神聖的故事, 直到我們都達到新耶路撒冷!

請繼續觀看牆上的照片以及架子裏所擺示的珍貴遺物。每一件東西和每一張照片皆顯示馬尼拉召會豐富的歷史和遺產。感謝你們參加這次的旅程。
