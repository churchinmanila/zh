<!--- TRANSCRIPT
Back in July 1937, before Brother Nee’s arrival, the church in Manila had planned to advertise the conference in newspapers and hang big banners on the streets to promote Watchman Nee, as was commonly practiced among preachers and evangelists. However, when Brother Nee learned of this, he adamantly opposed using human methods and propaganda for God’s work. He even threatened to call off the conference if the brothers did not cease the advertisement and promotion. The conference eventually proceeded, but only after all the publicity activities were halted.

讓我們回到 1937 年七月，倪弟兄來到之前，馬尼拉召會已定規好要登報宣傳，並掛橫街的大布廣告條來介紹倪柝聲，一如以前傳道者和佈道家所做的。然而倪柝聲一聽說很不贊同為著神的工作使用屬人的方法。他吩咐要馬上取消，原則他就不講，結果一切宣傳作用的舉動都不作了，才開始特會。
