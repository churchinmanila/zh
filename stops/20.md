王貽源從1951年到1960年或1961年忠信奉獻扶持臺灣的工作


<!--- TRANSCRIPT
Before we continue sharing how Brother Witness Lee helped the church in Manila, let's insert a short story about a brother named Wang, whom Brother Lee met on this trip. This brother had a significant impact on the work in Taiwan during its early stages.

While in Manila a few days before his return to Taiwan, Brother Lee was informed by Brother Huang Ho Seng that a certain Brother Wang wished to speak with him in private. At that time, Brother Wang had a very large business in the Philippines. He came alone to see Brother Lee and said, “Brother Lee, I have a burden for the work you are doing in Taiwan. Please tell me the amount of funds necessary for the entire work of the Lord in Taiwan when you return this time. Also, let me know the funds needed for the work in Taiwan every year, and I will offer the entire amount.”

Brother Lee replied, “Brother Wang, I would like to let you know that we have learned to serve the Lord since our youth, and one thing we learned is to never tell others about our needs and never ask for donations.”

Brother Wang responded, “Brother Lee, I absolutely know this principle. But you must know that you did not come to talk to me; neither have you asked for a donation; it is I who am entreating you. You are for the Lord, and I am also for the Lord. I came to entreat you; you must tell me.” 

Under such a circumstance, Brother Lee sensed that this was of the Lord, so he disclosed the amount. Brother Wang proved to be truly faithful. From 1951 to 1960 or 1961, he faithfully fulfilled his commitment each year.

Due to the financial provisions from Brother Wang, the original small meeting hall in Taipei was demolished and replaced with a larger one. Additionally, the funds were used to purchase land for halls two, three, and four, as well as a twenty-eight thousand square-foot plot for the Kaohsiung meeting hall. This support also enabled Brother Lee to initiate the publication of The Ministry of the Word in 1951 and to hold the first training in Taipei in 1952, which produced 80 to 100 full-time serving ones. The Lord’s work in Taiwan experienced significant growth and progress during this period.

One time, Brother Wang fellowshipped with Brother Lee, saying, “Brother Lee, I can tell you that sometimes I had to borrow the money to offer to the Lord because I did not have it.” Upon hearing this, Brother Lee was deeply moved, almost to tears. He would never forget the brothers and sisters of this family and earnestly prayed for the Lord’s abundant blessings upon them. Brother Wang is the older sibling of Betty Ong, one of the two sisters appointed by Brother Lee as a deaconess in 1951.

在繼續分享李常受弟兄如何幫助馬尼拉召會時，讓我們先插入一段小故事。這是關於李弟兄在旅程中遇見的一位王姓弟兄。這位弟兄對於臺灣早期的工作有極大的影響。

李弟兄從馬尼拉回臺灣的前幾天，黃和聲弟兄通知他有一位王弟兄願意私下跟他交談。當時王弟兄在菲律濱的生意作得很大。他來見李弟兄說:「李弟兄，我對你在臺灣的工作很有負擔。請你務必告訴我，你這次回去，臺灣島上整個主的工作，需要多少款項，以及每一年臺灣島上的工作需要多少款項，我要全數奉獻。」

李弟兄回答說:「王弟兄，我願意你知道，我們從年輕學習事奉主，就學了一個功課，從來不把我們的需要告訴人，從來不向人募捐。」

王弟兄回應說:「李弟兄，我絕對知道這原則。但你要知道，這不是你來告訴我，也不是你來募捐，是我來求你，是我來求你，你一定要告訴我。」

李弟兄感覺到這是出乎主的，所以把款項告訴他。王弟兄也非常忠誠。他從1951年，大約到1960或1961年，每一年他都完全照數辦理。

由於王弟兄財物的供給，臺北原本的小會所被拆掉，重建了一個較大的會所。不僅如此，這筆款項也用來購置二會所、三會所、四會所，以及高雄會所那塊七百八十坪的地。這個供給也幫助李弟兄於1951年開始出版話語職事的刊物，且於1952年在臺北舉行頭一次的訓練。當時產生了八十至一百位的全時間服事者。主在臺灣這段日子的工作經歷極大的成長和進展。

王弟兄有一次跟李弟兄交通說:「李弟兄，我告訴你，有時我奉獻這個款，並不是我有這個款，而是我代款來奉獻給主的。」李弟兄聽了，眼淚幾乎要落下來。他永不會忘記這一家的弟兄姊妹，且懇切禱告主豐厚的祝福他們。王弟兄是王淑貴的長兄。她是李弟兄於1951年所設立的兩位女執事其中之一位。
