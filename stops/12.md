<!--- TRANSCRIPT
In the conference, Brother Nee spoke on the overcoming life of Christ based on the book of Romans. His messages were similar to those he had delivered at the Overcomer Conference in China and would later deliver in England on his next leg of the journey. These messages were eventually published in the book The Normal Christian Life, considered a 20th-century Christian classic that sold over one million copies world-wide.

Brother Nee stayed for a month during his visit to the Philippines, spending most of his time in the cool city of Baguio, located in the northern mountains of the country. Aside from the conference, he delivered messages on several Lord’s Days, covering a variety of topics. On one Lord’s Day, he spoke about God’s eternal plan based on Genesis 1 and 2. On another, he discussed the topic “In Nothing Be Anxious.” On a third Lord’s Day, Brother Nee spoke about the ground of the church and our testimony. 

One time, in a meeting held by special request, Brother Nee spoke about the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Following that message, a time was set for Tuesday night at the house of Brother Huang Ho Seng for the saints to practically experience the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. That evening before the meeting, Brother Nee unexpectedly requested Brother Huang to take him to the seaside at Luneta. Surprised, Brother Huang asked, “What? Aren’t you going to lead us through this experience of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit?” Brother Nee replied, “No. I won’t be here. I am going to the seaside. The truth is, if I am present, you will not experience the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. If I am absent, then you will experience the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. I am going to the seaside to pray for you.”

So, following Brother Nee’s request, Brother Huang took him to the seaside. When the time came, about 20 brothers and sisters gathered, singing and praying. Everyone opened their mouths to praise the Lord. The atmosphere was so joyful and exuberant, and their shouts of praise could be heard far and near. Sure enough, the Holy Spirit was outpoured upon them! They prayed and praised until ten o’clock. By that time, Brother Nee had returned, and they excitedly related to him what had happened. Smilingly, Brother Nee motioned with his finger and said, “This is what I have been telling you about.”

From that point on, the different meetings of the church improved tremendously. No longer dead and weak, they became strong and released. Burning in spirit, the brothers and sisters spontaneously formed teams to give out gospel tracts everywhere. They invited or visited people to bring them to salvation. During every gospel meeting, a group would pray on the rooftop to support the one on the podium, stopping only when the meeting was over. Consequently, the number of those being saved increased significantly. 

倪弟兄在特會中是引羅馬書，講基督徒得勝的生活。他的信息內容跟他當時在國內各地開得勝聚會以及之後在英國所講的大同小異。這些信息後來出版為「基督 徒的正常生活」，算是廿世紀全球基督徒所出售書報的經典之作，共售中一萬多本。

倪弟兄訪問菲律濱時待了一個月，大部分時間是住在本國避暑勝地「碧瑤」。除了特會，他也在主日講到不同的主題。在一主日的信息，他根據創世記第一二章，講到神永遠的計劃。另一主日又講「應當一無掛慮」。又一主日講到教會的立場和我們的見證。

在一次特別請求聚會中，倪弟兄說到聖靈的澆灌。之後就定規在一個週二晚上假黃和聲弟兄的家聚會，為要讓聖徒得著聖靈的澆灌。當晚聚會前，倪弟兄卻要求黃弟兄把他帶到 Luneta 海邊去。黃弟兄說，「為甚麼?你不是要帶領我們過聖靈澆灌 的關嗎?」他說，「不，我不在這裏，我要到海邊去。真的，我若在，你們不會被聖靈澆灌，我若不在，你們才會被聖靈澆灌，我到海邊為你們禱告去。」

結果黃弟兄只得依命，把他送到海邊去。時候一到，大約廿位弟兄姊妹聚在一起唱 詩禱告。大家開口讚美主，果然就受聖靈的澆灌。他們在主同在的喜樂中，歡呼讚 美之聲，遠近可聞，禱告讚美，直到十時方才停下來。那時倪弟兄已回來，他們把經過情形告訴他。他聽了笑笑地，用手指頭一點說，「這個」就是我對你們說的 「那個」。

從那時候起，教會各種聚會大大改觀。聚會從死沉軟弱，變為剛強釋放。弟兄姊妹靈裏焚燒，自動自發地分隊成群，四處分發單張，請客探望帶人得救。每於傳福音時，總有一班人在樓蓋頂用禱告扶持站講台的人，直到聚會結束為止，結果得救的人數，時有加增。
