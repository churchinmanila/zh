倪柝聲親自見證了歐洲和美國弟兄會的分裂，促使他得著負擔搜尋聖經中關於地方召會的界限。


<!--- TRANSCRIPT
Thank the Lord, in 1937, the opportunity opened up for Watchman Nee to stop by Manila on his way to England. That year was a pivotal moment in Brother Nee's life. Earlier, he had visited the Brethren Assemblies in Europe and America and personally witnessed the great division among them. In one city, there was often a Brethren assembly on one street and another Brethren assembly on another street. In Vancouver alone, there were 30 independent assemblies, none of them having anything to do with the others. 

Brother Nee returned to China with a heavy burden in his spirit. He searched the Scriptures to study the boundary of a local church. By the time he came to Manila in July 1937, he was very clear that the boundary of a local church is the boundary of the city where the local church is located. This ground, he believed, was essential to preserving oneness and avoiding division among believers.  

感謝主於 1937 年給了倪柝聲機會在前往英國時途經馬尼拉。那一年是倪弟兄人 生的一大轉捩點。他前段日子訪問了歐洲的弟兄會和美國，親自見證他們當中的極大分裂。在一個城市裏通常是一條街道有弟兄會，接著另一條街道又有另一個弟兄會。單單溫哥華市就有三十個自由團體，同時這些團體彼此是全然沒有聯系的。

倪弟兄靈裏帶著沉重的負擔回到中國。他研讀聖經中關於地方召會的界限，因此 1937 年七月來到馬尼拉時，他已經對於一個地方召會的界限就是一個地方召會所處之城市的界限有清楚的看見。他相信這個立場對於保守合一和避免信徒中間的分裂是極其重要的。
