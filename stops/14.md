<!--- TRANSCRIPT
When the brothers in Manila heard Brother Nee’s praise of Witness Lee, they immediately corresponded with Brother Lee, inviting him to come to the Philippines to help with the work. They also began processing all the necessary requirements for his visit. However, their plans were interrupted by the outbreak of World War II. 

當馬尼拉的弟兄們聽到倪弟兄對李常受的稱讚，他們立刻去函邀請他來菲幫忙，且已為他辦好來非入境手續，但卻受戰爭的打岔。
