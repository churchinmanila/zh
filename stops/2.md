title: 主恢復的工作
-->
主在第二個千年之交期間使用了一班忠信的信徒來恢復不同的真理。


<!--- TRANSCRIPT
Despite this, the Lord continuously moved to carry out His work of recovery among groups of believers who often faced persecution for seeking the truth. During the second millennium, several groups of faithful ones recovered item after item of the truths that had been lost through long periods of neglect, oversight, or opposition. Still, by the late 1800s, the situation in Europe and America had become exceedingly confused, with Christians deeply divided due to the conflicting influences of Roman Catholicism, state churches, and private or independent churches.

儘管如此，主持續在一班為了尋求真理而時常遭受逼迫的信徒中間行動以完成祂 恢復的工作。在第二個千年世記中，一批又一批的忠信者恢復了一些長久受到忽略， 疏忽或遭人反對的真理。然而直到 1800 末期，歐洲和美國的光景仍然處在一片混亂的光景中。基督徒受到羅馬天主教、國教以及私立或獨立召會的沖突影響而經歷一次又一次的分裂。
