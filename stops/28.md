風波後經過數年在1007王彬街建築新的會所，即目前的一會所。


<!--- TRANSCRIPT
Eventually, in 1969, all those who were sanctified and loved the Lord out of a pure heart, who gave themselves for Christ and the church, stood as one and obtained a piece of land to erect a new meeting hall in the central district of the city at 1007 Ongpin Street. This became the present-day Meeting Hall #1 of the church in Manila.

至終1969年，所有蒙主聖別和清心愛主，為基督和召會奉獻自己的聖徒們同心獲得一塊位於1007王彬街的地皮以建築新的會所。這也是今時馬尼拉召會的一會 所。
