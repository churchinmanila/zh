倪柝聲訪問的一個晚上，當他跟一些弟兄們到海邊時，推薦了李常受驚人的成長。這是馬尼拉弟兄們頭一次聽到關於李常受。

<!--- TRANSCRIPT
One evening while he was in Manila, Brother Nee went for a walk by the seaside with some brothers. During their fellowship, he cheerfully shared, “I met a brother in northern China with a very bright spiritual future.” Brother Nee was referring to Witness Lee. He continued, “His spiritual growth is extraordinary. Others grow as if crawling, but he is flying. I gave him a Bible with notes…”

Thus, 1937 marked the first time the brothers in Manila heard about Witness Lee. Brother Lee was saved in the northern city of Chefoo in April 1925. By June 1932, he met Watchman Nee for the first time in Chefoo when Nee accepted his invitation to visit. A year later, in 1933, after much prayer and seeking before the Lord, Witness Lee dropped his job and his own spiritual work in Chefoo to join Watchman Nee's work in Shanghai. He had seen the light from the book of Acts that there is only one work, one flow, in the Lord’s recovery. Thus, he willingly and gladly handed himself over to do the same work with Watchman Nee.


當倪弟兄在馬尼拉期間，有一晚上，同幾位弟兄到海邊散步。在說話交通中， 他很喜樂的說，「我在北方碰到一位很有屬靈前途的弟兄。」他是指著李常受。他 繼續說，「他屬靈的長進是特別的，別人的長進是爬的，但他是飛的，我送他一部 聖經註解...」

馬尼拉的弟兄們於 1937 年頭一次聽到關於李常受。李弟兄於 1925 年四月在北方煙台得救。他於 1932 年六月第一次碰見倪柝聲。當時倪弟兄接受他的邀請來訪問。 一年後即 1933 年，李常受在主面前極力禱告和尋求後便放下職業以及他在煙台的屬靈工作，然後到上海參於倪柝聲的工作。他從使徒行傳得著亮光，看見主的恢復只有一個工作，一個流。因此，他歡喜自願把自己交出來跟倪柝聲作同樣的工作。
