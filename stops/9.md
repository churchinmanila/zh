他來馬尼拉之日，弟兄們到碼頭歡迎他。


<!--- TRANSCRIPT
On the day of his arrival in Manila, the brothers eagerly gathered at the pier to welcome Brother Nee. As the ship docked, it took a while before they saw a tall man standing by the railings, smiling and waving at them while waiting to disembark.

倪弟兄來馬尼拉之日，弟兄們到碼頭歡迎他，船靠了岸，看了好久，才見一位高個子的大漢站在欄干旁邊，笑微微的向他們揮揮手，等著下船。
