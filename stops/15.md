菲律濱1941年被日軍侵佔。1945年美軍來光復釋放菲律濱。

<!--- TRANSCRIPT
In 1941, the Philippines fell under Japanese occupation. For a time, the Japanese did not allow the church to congregate. Through prayers in one accord, the church passed through this dark period of trial and reemerged with hope. Soon, the meetings of the church were restored, and the gospel prevailed amid the climate of fear and apprehension in people’s hearts. The number of those being saved steadily increased.

By 1945, American troops arrived to liberate the Philippines, forcing the Japanese troops to retreat, but not without wreaking havoc along the way.

1941年，菲島淪陷到日軍手中，不許教會聚會。教會藉著同心合意的禱告， 經過了一段黑暗時期的試煉，又重現光明，不久教會恢復聚會，同心興旺福音。那時人心惶惶不安，朝不保夕，因此福音顯出大能，得救的人數，一再增加。
至1945年，美軍來光復，日軍撤退，卻大肆破壞。
