<!--- TRANSCRIPT
Afterward, arrangements were made for him to stay in the house of Brother Huang Ho Seng and his sister, Ng Chu Ai - the same siblings who extended hospitality to Watchman Nee thirteen years earlier. 

It is of great historic significance to note that the very ground where you stand today is where the house once stood that accommodated both Watchman Nee and Witness Lee!

之後安排他住到黃和聲弟兄和他妹妹黃慈愛姊妹的家。他們也是十三年前接待倪柝聲的那對兄妹。這棟房子曾經容納了倪柝聲和李常受兩位，具有極大的歷史意義。
