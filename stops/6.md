菲律賓華僑黃和聲於1930年訪問中國廈門，接觸了主恢復的流


<!--- TRANSCRIPT
At this juncture in history, in the bustling city of Manila, over a thousand kilometers south of the Chinese coast of Fujian, lived a sizable population of overseas Chinese who had migrated to the Philippines to escape economic hardship and political instability in China. Many of them were Christians who gathered at St. Stephen’s parish, an Anglican-Episcopalian church in Manila.

Among them was Brother Huang Ho Seng, a medical practitioner whose clinic once stood on the very ground where this History Center stands today.

In 1930, Huang Ho Seng and his newlywed wife went on a honeymoon to Xiamen, China. There, by the Lord’s sovereignty, he touched the flow of the Lord’s recovery. Upon his return to Manila, Brother Huang enthusiastically shared his newfound enlightenment with some fellow believers. Inspired by his testimony, a group of them decided to leave the Anglican-Episcopalian sect. They rented a place on Nueva Street and began meeting under the name of United Christians Society.

In 1935, the brothers invited Leland Wang, a contemporary of Watchman Nee under M.E. Barber, who by then had become a traveling evangelist, to come to Manila to hold gospel outreaches and revival meetings. Following these meetings, Brother Wang recommended his co-worker, Simon Meek, to come and serve in Manila. Three years later, Lucas Wu, another co-worker from China, joined the work in Manila at Brother Meek's request.

這時距離福建南邊外海的千公里之外的繁華之市馬尼拉也正好住著一批為了逃離內地的經濟困境和政治的不穩而移居到菲律濱的華僑。他們好多人都是基督徒，且一同在馬尼拉的聖公會聚集。

其中一位是黃和聲弟兄。他是一位醫生。他的診所就開在今天歷史中心的建築之地。

黃和聲和他的新婚妻子於1930年到中國廈門度蜜月。他在主的主宰之下碰到主恢復的流。黃弟兄回到馬尼拉後就把他裏面被主開啟的亮光熱切分享給其他信徒。他們當中一些人受到鼓舞離開了聖公會，然後在後街仔租房聚會，名為「基督徒聯合會」。

弟兄們於一九三五年邀請跟倪柝聲一同受教於和受恩之下的王載弟兄前來馬尼拉。他是歷遊各地的傳教士。他來馬尼拉開奮興佈道會。之後經由王弟兄的推薦繆紹訓弟兄也前來馬尼拉服事。三年後中國另一位同工Lucas Wu在繆弟兄的請求之下也參於了馬尼拉的工作。
